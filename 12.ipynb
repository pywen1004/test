        "12. Write a Python program that simulates a music streaming service. Your system should support the following functionalities:\n",
        "\n",
        "Users can \"subscribe\" to different music genres.\n",
        "Users can view their subscribed genres and discover new music.\n",
        "Users can play a list of songs from their subscribed genres.\n",

        "Requirements:\n",
        "Implement a MusicStreamingService class with methods for subscribing to genres,\n",

        "Create a Song class that includes attributes like title, artist, and duration.\n",
        "Ensure that users can browse available genres and the songs within each genre before making a subscription.\n",
